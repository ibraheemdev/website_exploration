Just as Nu extends from the single string data type of Unix, Nu also extends the idea of the pipeline to include more than just text.</p><h2 id=basics>Basics</h2><p>A pipeline is constructed with three parts: the input, the filter, and the output.</p><pre><code>&gt; open &quot;Cargo.toml&quot; | inc package.version | save &quot;Cargo_new.toml&quot;
</code></pre><p>The first command, <code>open "Cargo.toml"</code>, is an input (sometimes also called a &ldquo;source&rdquo; or &ldquo;producer&rdquo;). This creates or loads data and feeds it into a pipeline. It&rsquo;s from input that pipelines have values to work with. Commands like <code>ls</code> are also inputs, as they take data from the filesystem and send it through the pipelines so that it can be used.</p><p>The second command, <code>inc package.version</code>, is a filter. Filters take the data they are given and often do something with it. They may change it (as with the <code>inc</code> command in our example), or they may do another operation, like logging, as the values pass through.</p><p>The last command, <code>save "Cargo_new.toml"</code>, is an output (sometimes called a &ldquo;sink&rdquo;). An output takes input from the pipeline and does some final operation on it. In our example, we save what comes through the pipeline to a file as the final step. Other types of output commands may take the values and view them for the user.</p><h2 id=working-with-external-commands>Working with external commands</h2><p>Nu commands communicate with each other using the Nu data types (see <a href=types_of_data.md>types of data</a>), but what about commands outside of Nu? Let&rsquo;s look at some examples of working with external commands:</p><p><code>internal_command | external_command</code></p><p>Data will flow from the internal_command to the external_command. This data is expected to be strings, so that they can be sent to the <code>stdin</code> of the external_command.</p><p><code>external_command | internal_command</code></p><p>Data coming from an external command into Nu will collect into a single string, and then will be passed into internal_command. Commands like <code>lines</code> help make it easier to bring in data from external commands in such a way that it&rsquo;s easier to work with.</p><p><code>external_command_1 | external_command_2</code></p><p>Nu works with data piped between two external commands in the same way as other shells, like Bash would. The <code>stdout</code> of external_command_1 is connected to the <code>stdin</code> of external_command_2. This lets data flow naturally between the two commands.</p><h2 id=behind-the-scenes>Behind the scenes</h2><p>You may have wondered how we see a table if <code>ls</code> is an input and not an output. Nu adds this output for us automatically using another command called <code>autoview</code>. The <code>autoview</code> command is appended to any pipeline that doesn&rsquo;t have an output allowing us to see the result.</p><p>In effect, the command:</p><pre><code>&gt; ls
</code></pre><p>And the pipeline:</p><pre><code>&gt; ls | autoview
</code></pre><p>Are one and the same.</p></main><hr class=footer-line><div class=language-footer><a href=https://www.nushell.sh/website_exploration/es/docs/book/pipeline/>es: El pipeline</a></div></body></html>
